# Audio Asset Rejection Log

## Rejected Assets and Reasons

### Background Music
- **Rejected**: `spaceEngine_000.ogg` - Too harsh/mechanical for background
- **Rejected**: `spaceEngineLow_000.ogg` - Still too engine-like, not pleasant
- **Rejected**: `engineCircular_000.ogg` - Too repetitive and mechanical
- **Decision**: Disabled background music entirely - none of the engine sounds were suitable

### Tower Upgrade Sounds
- **Rejected**: `powerUp1.ogg` - Too techy/digital, sounded like electronic beeps
- **Accepted**: `impactBell_heavy_000.ogg` - Pleasant bell sound, more satisfying

### Wave Start Sounds
- **Rejected**: `jingles_NES00.ogg` - Too circusy/mocking, 8-bit style inappropriate
- **Accepted**: `jingles_STEEL00.ogg` - More serious tone, appropriate for wave announcements

### Enemy Spawn Sounds
- **Rejected**: `doorOpen_000.ogg` - Too high-pitched and harsh
- **Accepted**: `impactSoft_medium_001.ogg` - Softer, more pleasant impact sound

### Wave Completion Sounds
- **Accepted**: `jingles_STEEL01.ogg` - Pleasant steel jingle for wave completion
- **Note**: Different from wave start to avoid confusion

### Countdown Sounds
- **Accepted**: `impactGeneric_light_000.ogg` - Light impact for countdown thuds
- **Note**: Light impact works well for countdown beats

## Notes
- Engine sounds from sci-fi pack are too mechanical for pleasant background music
- Digital audio pack sounds are too techy for fantasy tower defense
- Impact sounds work well for game events
- Steel jingles are more serious than 8-bit jingles
- Soft impacts are better than door sounds for spawn events
- Light impacts work well for countdown beats
- Different steel jingles can be used for different wave events
