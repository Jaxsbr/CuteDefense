- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Satisfying pulse animation working
- **Commit**: daa18fb - feat(resource): complete Sprint 5 resource enhancement

## Technical Accomplishments

### Code Changes
- **Modified Files**:
  - `src/systems/TowerSystem.js` - Added damage system integration to projectile hits
  - `src/managers/TowerManager.js` - Updated to pass enemySystem to TowerSystem
  - `src/game.js` - Updated game loop to connect all systems and scale improvements
  - `src/systems/ResourceSystem.js` - Added collection effects and pulse animation
  - `src/systems/RenderSystem.js` - Enhanced coin rendering and pulse animation
  - `src/data/towerTypes.js` - Increased damage values and tower sizes for better visibility

### System Integration
- **New Integration Points**: Projectile hits now trigger enemy damage and coin spawning
- **Event Flow**: Towers shoot → Projectiles hit → Enemies take damage → Coins spawn on death
- **Resource System**: Coin spawning integrated with enemy death rewards
- **Visual Feedback**: Sparkle effects and coin total pulse animation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Scale Improvement**: Doubled tile size (32px → 64px) for better visibility
- **Combat Balance**: Increased tower damage (1→25, 3→60) for faster testing
- **Simplified Effects**: Removed complex floating indicators in favor of simple pulse animation

## Testing Results

### Manual Tests Performed
- ✅ **Combat System**: Towers shoot projectiles that damage enemies
- ✅ **Coin Spawning**: Coins spawn at enemy death locations
- ✅ **Coin Collection**: Clickable coins with satisfying visual feedback
- ✅ **Scale Improvements**: Better visibility with 64px tiles
- ✅ **Pulse Animation**: Coin total display pulses when coins are added

### Regression Checks
- ✅ **Previous Features Work**: All existing systems still functional
- ✅ **Performance Impact**: No noticeable performance issues
- ✅ **Visual Correctness**: All elements properly scaled and positioned

## Sprint 5 Completion Summary
