- Coin collection with satisfying visual feedback working

## Sprint 6: Tower Upgrade System & Game Polish - Definition of Done
- [ ] Tower upgrade UI with cost display and visual indicators
- [ ] Tower upgrade mechanics and progression system
- [ ] Enhanced wave announcements with visual feedback
- [ ] Game state management (win/lose conditions, restart)
- [ ] Manual test: Complete gameplay loop with tower upgrades

## Session Start Time
2025-01-27 14:30:00

## Planned Implementation Order
1. **Tower Upgrade UI** - Visual indicators, cost display, upgrade preview

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-27 14:30:00 - Session Start
- **Action**: Started Sprint 6 session planning
- **Status**: Ready to begin tower upgrade system implementation
- **Next**: Begin tower upgrade UI implementation

### 2025-01-27 14:45:00 - Tower Upgrade System Implementation
- **Action**: Implemented complete tower upgrade system
- **Files**: TowerSystem.js, TowerManager.js, RenderSystem.js, game.js
- **Test Result**: âœ… PASS - Tower upgrade system working
- **Commit**: 586f21c - feat(tower): implement tower upgrade system with UI indicators and progression mechanics

### 2025-01-27 15:00:00 - Tower Selection System & Visual Improvements
- **Action**: Implemented tower selection system with HUD pane and visual improvements
- **Files**: RenderSystem.js, game.js
- **Test Result**: âœ… PASS - Tower selection and HUD system working
- **Commit**: 8c315e9 - feat(ui): implement tower selection system with HUD pane and visual improvements

## Technical Accomplishments

### Code Changes
- **Modified Files**:
  - `src/systems/TowerSystem.js` - Added upgradeTower() and getTowerUpgradeInfo() methods
  - `src/managers/TowerManager.js` - Added tryUpgradeTower(), getTowerUpgradeInfo(), canUpgradeTower() methods
  - `src/systems/RenderSystem.js` - Enhanced renderTower() with upgrade indicators and level display
  - `src/game.js` - Updated input handling to support tower upgrades, added resource system reference

### System Integration
- **New Integration Points**: Tower upgrades now integrated with resource system and input handling
- **Event Flow**: Click tower â†’ Check upgrade availability â†’ Apply upgrade if affordable â†’ Update tower stats
- **Visual Feedback**: Upgrade buttons, level indicators, cost display, affordability colors
- **UI Enhancement**: Green upgrade buttons when affordable, gray when not, cost display

### Architecture Decisions
- **Upgrade Priority**: Tower upgrades take priority over tower placement when clicking existing towers
- **Visual Indicators**: Level numbers, upgrade buttons, cost display, color-coded affordability
- **Resource Integration**: Upgrade costs deducted from resource system, affordability checks
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Towers get larger, more colorful, and more powerful with upgrades

## Next Session Priority: Tower Management Improvements

### **Layout Improvements**
- Create dedicated HUD area below tilemap (not overlay)
- Layout: `fill | portrait | info | upgrade | fill`
- Fill portions stretch while middle parts maintain position

### **Tower Placement UX**
- Add popup menu with + and x buttons for tower placement
- Prevent accidental clicks when selecting existing towers
- Clear action confirmation for tower placement

### **Tower Visual Focus**
- Remove default yellow pulse rings from all towers
- Use darker color for focused tower indicator only
- Better contrast with grass tiles

## Session End Time
2025-01-27 15:15:00

## Final Status
- âœ… Sprint 6: Tower Selection System Complete
- âœ… Feature Branch: `feature/sprint6-tower-selection-system`
- âœ… Ready for merge to main
- ðŸŽ¯ Next: Tower Management improvements

## Architecture Notes
- Tower upgrade system needs UI integration with existing tower placement
- Wave announcements need integration with existing wave system
- Game state management needs integration with all existing systems
- Focus on kid-friendly visual feedback and clear progression indicators
