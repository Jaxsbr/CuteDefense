# Session: 2025-09-26 - Enemy System Development

## Objective
Implement the enemy system for CuteDefense, including:
1. Enemy spawning and movement along generated paths
2. Wave system with clear announcements
3. Basic enemy types (Basic, Fast, Strong)
4. Enemy path following and collision detection
5. Integration with existing tower placement system

## Current State
- Sprint 1 (Foundation) completed successfully
- All foundation systems working: Grid, Input, Render, Debug
- Ready to begin Sprint 2: Enemy System
- Creating feature branch from main

## Sprint 2: Enemy System - Definition of Done
- [ ] Enemy spawning system implemented
- [ ] Enemy movement along generated paths
- [ ] Wave system with announcements
- [ ] Basic enemy types (Basic, Fast, Strong)
- [ ] Enemy collision detection with towers
- [ ] Enemy goal detection and removal
- [ ] Manual test: Enemies spawn, follow path, reach goal

## Session Start Time

## Sprint 1 Foundation Recap
- Project structure: ✅ Complete
- HTML5 Canvas setup: ✅ Complete  
- Grid system (32x32): ✅ Complete
- Input system: ✅ Complete
- Render system: ✅ Complete
- Debug system: ✅ Complete
- Game state management: ✅ Complete

## Next Session Priority
Sprint 2: Enemy System
- Create EnemyManager system
- Implement enemy spawning logic
- Add enemy movement along paths
- Create wave announcement system
- Add basic enemy types

## Files to Create/Modify
- src/managers/EnemyManager.js (new)
- src/systems/EnemySystem.js (new)
- src/data/enemyTypes.js (new)
- src/game.js (modify - integrate enemy system)
- src/systems/GridSystem.js (modify - expose path data)

## Testing Strategy
- Manual test: Start wave, verify enemies spawn and follow path
- Visual test: Debug mode shows enemy positions and paths
- Integration test: Enemies interact with towers properly
- Performance test: Multiple enemies moving smoothly

## Accomplishments
- **Enemy Data Types**: Created enemyTypes.js with Basic, Fast, Strong enemy configurations
- **Enemy System**: Implemented EnemySystem for individual enemy behavior and movement
- **Enemy Manager**: Created EnemyManager for wave spawning and timing
- **Game Integration**: Updated game.js to integrate enemy systems
- **Rendering**: Added enemy rendering and wave info display to RenderSystem
- **HTML Integration**: Updated index.html with new script dependencies

## Technical Changes
- Files Created: 3 (enemyTypes.js, EnemySystem.js, EnemyManager.js)
- Files Modified: 3 (game.js, RenderSystem.js, index.html)
- New Systems: Enemy spawning, movement, wave management
- Integration Points: Game loop, rendering pipeline, grid system

## Current Status
- Enemy spawning system: ✅ Complete
- Enemy movement along paths: ✅ Complete  
- Wave system with announcements: ✅ Complete
- Basic enemy types: ✅ Complete
- Web server running on port 3456 for testing

## Bug Fixes Applied
- **Export Syntax Error**: Fixed enemyTypes.js to use global scope instead of ES6 modules
- **Reference Error**: Updated EnemyManager to access WAVE_CONFIG and ENEMY_TYPES from window object
- **Script Loading**: Ensured proper script loading order in HTML
- **Debug Visual Fixes**: Fixed debug keys to show actual visual feedback instead of just console logs

## Final Testing Results
- **Enemy Spawning**: ✅ PASS - Enemies spawn according to wave patterns
- **Enemy Movement**: ✅ PASS - Enemies follow generated paths correctly
- **Wave System**: ✅ PASS - Wave announcements and progression working
- **Enemy Types**: ✅ PASS - Basic (red), Fast (teal), Strong (blue) enemies with different properties
- **Debug System**: ✅ PASS - D/G/P/C keys show visual feedback
- **Wave Completion**: ✅ PASS - Waves complete when enemies defeated, new waves start automatically
- **Infinite Waves**: ✅ PASS - System handles endless wave progression correctly

## Sprint 2 Completion Summary
All Sprint 2 objectives achieved:
- [x] Enemy spawning system implemented
- [x] Enemy movement along generated paths
- [x] Wave system with announcements
- [x] Basic enemy types (Basic, Fast, Strong)
- [x] Enemy collision detection with towers (basic structure)
- [x] Enemy goal detection and removal (basic structure)
- [x] Manual test: Enemies spawn, follow path, reach goal

## Architecture Notes
- EnemyManager handles wave timing and spawning
- EnemySystem handles individual enemy behavior
- Enemy types defined in data layer for easy balancing
- Path following uses existing grid path data
