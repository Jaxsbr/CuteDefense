## Sprint 5 Planning Assessment
Based on game specification analysis:
- **Resource System**: Currently basic - needs enhancement for kid-friendly experience
- **Tower Upgrades**: Defined but not fully implemented - needs visual progression
- **Economy Balance**: Needs testing and refinement for appropriate difficulty curve
- **Visual Polish**: Core mechanics working - focus on satisfying feedback loops

## Next Session Priority
Begin Sprint 5 implementation with enhanced coin collection mechanics and visual feedback systems.

## Architecture Notes
- Resource system needs enhancement for better visual feedback
- Tower upgrade system needs UI integration
- Economy balance requires playtesting and adjustment
- Focus on kid-friendly visual and audio feedback throughout
