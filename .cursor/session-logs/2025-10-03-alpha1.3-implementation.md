## Progress Log

### Fri Oct  3 10:32:52 NZDT 2025 - Session Start
- **Git Status**: feature/sprint-1.3-alpha - Clean working tree
- **Starting Point**: Alpha 1.2 completed with 28 major improvements, ready for Alpha 1.3
- **Target**: Implement user-requested polish improvements and new features

### Fri Oct  3 10:45:00 NZDT 2025 - Enemy Death Sound & Animation Enhancement
- **Objective**: Fix/enhance enemy death sound and add dramatic death animation
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased enemy death sound volume from 0.7 to 0.9 for more dramatic effect
  - Added `startDramaticDeathAnimation()` method with explosion and sparkle effects
  - Added `renderDramaticDeathEffects()` method for visual explosion rings and golden sparkles
  - Enhanced death animation duration from 0.5s to 1.2s for more satisfying effect
  - Added 8 sparkle particles that fly outward from death point
  - Added expanding explosion ring effect (3x enemy size radius)

### Fri Oct  3 10:50:00 NZDT 2025 - Enhanced Death Particle Effects
- **Objective**: Make death particles more visible and dramatic
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased particle count from 8 to 16 for more dramatic effect
  - Added random angle variation (¬±0.25 radians) for organic spread
  - Enhanced speed variation (30-120 pixels/second) for more dynamic movement
  - Added random color selection from golden/red spectrum (#FFD700, #FFA500, #FF6347, #FF4500, #FFFF00)
  - Increased size variation (4-12 pixels) for better visibility
  - Added random life duration variation (0.8-1.2 seconds)
  - Added rotation and rotation speed for spinning sparkle effect
  - Changed particle rendering from circles to cross/star shapes for more dramatic visual impact
  - Increased glow effect (shadowBlur 12) for better visibility
  - Added individual particle alpha fading based on remaining life

### Fri Oct  3 10:55:00 NZDT 2025 - Match Coin Expiration Effect Scale
- **Objective**: Make death particles match the scale and intensity of coin expiration effects
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased particle count from 16 to 20 to match coin expiration intensity
  - Updated speed to match coin expiration (100-180 pixels/second vs previous 30-120)
  - Updated size to match coin expiration (4-10 pixels vs previous 4-12)
  - Updated life duration to match coin expiration (1.5-2 seconds vs previous 0.8-1.2)
  - Added strong upward bias (-30 pixels/second) like coin expiration
  - Simplified rendering from star shapes to circles like coin expiration
  - Reduced glow effect to match coin expiration (shadowBlur 6 vs 12)
  - Matched rotation speed to coin expiration effect

### Fri Oct  3 11:00:00 NZDT 2025 - Fix Death Animation Update Loop
- **Issue Found**: Death animation was not being updated because updateEnemyVisualEffects() was never called
- **Critical Fix**:
  - Added updateEnemyVisualEffects() call to main update loop for all enemies
  - Added debug logging to confirm death animation triggering
  - Death animations now properly update and display particle effects

### Fri Oct  3 11:05:00 NZDT 2025 - Make Death Animation Violent and Explosive
- **Objective**: Transform wispy cloud into violent flying chunks with "ka boom" effect
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased particle count from 20 to 30 for more dramatic explosion
  - Increased speed from 100-180 to 200-400 pixels/second for violent impact
  - Increased size from 4-10 to 8-20 pixels for larger flying chunks
  - Changed colors to violent reds/oranges/dark browns (#FF0000, #8B0000, #654321, etc.)
  - Added gravity physics (150-250) for realistic falling chunks
  - Increased upward bias from -30 to -50 for more explosive launch
  - Faster rotation speed (2.0 vs 0.3) for spinning debris
  - Shorter life duration (0.8-1.5s vs 1.5-2s) for quick violent impact
  - Changed particle rendering from circles to jagged hexagonal chunks
  - Added dark outlines to chunks for more dramatic effect
  - Enhanced explosion rings with multiple color waves (red/white/yellow)
  - Increased explosion ring thickness and glow effects

### Fri Oct  3 11:10:00 NZDT 2025 - Difficulty-Based Map Selection (Phase 1)
- **Objective**: Implement difficulty-based map selection with Easy (long paths) vs Hard (short paths)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added difficulty property to GridSystem (default: 'easy')
  - Modified selectRandomTemplate() to filter templates by difficulty
  - Easy difficulty: Long winding paths (30+ steps) - uses existing templates
  - Hard difficulty: Short direct paths (15-25 steps) - uses new short templates
  - Added 2 new hard path templates: "Hard Direct" (16 steps) and "Hard Zigzag" (16 steps)
  - Added setDifficulty() method to switch difficulties and regenerate paths
  - Added keyboard shortcuts: '1' for Easy, '2' for Hard difficulty switching
  - Added logging for difficulty changes and path regeneration

### Fri Oct  3 11:15:00 NZDT 2025 - Death Animation Debugging & Sound Fix
- **Issue Found**: Death animation not rendering, sound not playing
- **Root Cause**: Animation timing issue - duration in seconds (1.2) vs deltaTime in milliseconds
- **Critical Fixes**:
  - Fixed animation duration from 1.2 seconds to 1200 milliseconds
  - Replaced soft enemy_death.ogg with dramatic impactMetal_heavy_000.ogg sound
  - Fixed explosion radius calculation (was 2.4px, increased to 60px then 30px)
  - Added comprehensive debug logging to identify timing issues
  - Confirmed updateEnemyVisualEffects() was being called properly

### Fri Oct  3 11:20:00 NZDT 2025 - Death Animation Polish & Color Palette
- **Objective**: Make death effect appropriate for cute game aesthetic
- **Changes Made**:
  - Reduced particle count from 30 to 12 for gentler effect
  - Changed from violent reds/oranges to pastel colors matching game palette
  - Reduced explosion radius from 60px to 30px for appropriate scale
  - Slowed particle speed from 200-400 to 60-140 pixels/second
  - Reduced particle size from 8-20px to 3-8px for smaller chunks
  - Changed from jagged chunks back to simple circular sparkles
  - Updated explosion rings to use pastel colors (pink, yellow, lavender)
  - Reduced animation duration from 1200ms to 800ms
  - Made physics gentler (reduced gravity, upward bias, rotation speed)
