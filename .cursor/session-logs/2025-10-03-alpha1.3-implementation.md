# Session: 2025-10-03 - Sprint 1.3 Alpha Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `feature/sprint-1.3-alpha`  
**Start Time**: Fri Oct  3 10:32:52 NZDT 2025  
**Session Goal**: Implement Alpha 1.3 polish improvements and new features

---

## Planned Objectives
- [ ] Fix/Enhance Enemy Death Sound - Currently low/none, needs dramatic improvement
- [ ] Dramatic Enemy Death Animation - Make death more noticeable and satisfying
- [ ] Difficulty-Based Map Selection - Easy (long paths) vs Hard (short paths) with 4 maps total
- [ ] Cartoony Start Menu - Complete menu system with difficulty options and sound toggle

## Progress Log

### Fri Oct  3 10:32:52 NZDT 2025 - Session Start
- **Git Status**: feature/sprint-1.3-alpha - Clean working tree
- **Starting Point**: Alpha 1.2 completed with 28 major improvements, ready for Alpha 1.3
- **Target**: Implement user-requested polish improvements and new features

### Fri Oct  3 10:45:00 NZDT 2025 - Enemy Death Sound & Animation Enhancement
- **Objective**: Fix/enhance enemy death sound and add dramatic death animation
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased enemy death sound volume from 0.7 to 0.9 for more dramatic effect
  - Added `startDramaticDeathAnimation()` method with explosion and sparkle effects
  - Added `renderDramaticDeathEffects()` method for visual explosion rings and golden sparkles
  - Enhanced death animation duration from 0.5s to 1.2s for more satisfying effect
  - Added 8 sparkle particles that fly outward from death point
  - Added expanding explosion ring effect (3x enemy size radius)

### Fri Oct  3 10:50:00 NZDT 2025 - Enhanced Death Particle Effects
- **Objective**: Make death particles more visible and dramatic
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased particle count from 8 to 16 for more dramatic effect
  - Added random angle variation (¬±0.25 radians) for organic spread
  - Enhanced speed variation (30-120 pixels/second) for more dynamic movement
  - Added random color selection from golden/red spectrum (#FFD700, #FFA500, #FF6347, #FF4500, #FFFF00)
  - Increased size variation (4-12 pixels) for better visibility
  - Added random life duration variation (0.8-1.2 seconds)
  - Added rotation and rotation speed for spinning sparkle effect
  - Changed particle rendering from circles to cross/star shapes for more dramatic visual impact
  - Increased glow effect (shadowBlur 12) for better visibility
  - Added individual particle alpha fading based on remaining life

### Fri Oct  3 10:55:00 NZDT 2025 - Match Coin Expiration Effect Scale
- **Objective**: Make death particles match the scale and intensity of coin expiration effects
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased particle count from 16 to 20 to match coin expiration intensity
  - Updated speed to match coin expiration (100-180 pixels/second vs previous 30-120)
  - Updated size to match coin expiration (4-10 pixels vs previous 4-12)
  - Updated life duration to match coin expiration (1.5-2 seconds vs previous 0.8-1.2)
  - Added strong upward bias (-30 pixels/second) like coin expiration
  - Simplified rendering from star shapes to circles like coin expiration
  - Reduced glow effect to match coin expiration (shadowBlur 6 vs 12)
  - Matched rotation speed to coin expiration effect

### Fri Oct  3 11:00:00 NZDT 2025 - Fix Death Animation Update Loop
- **Issue Found**: Death animation was not being updated because updateEnemyVisualEffects() was never called
- **Critical Fix**:
  - Added updateEnemyVisualEffects() call to main update loop for all enemies
  - Added debug logging to confirm death animation triggering
  - Death animations now properly update and display particle effects
