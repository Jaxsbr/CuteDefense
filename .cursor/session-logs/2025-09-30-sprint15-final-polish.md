## Sprint 15 Definition of Done

### Remaining Core Features
- [ ] **Win/Lose Conditions**: Clear game ending mechanics and feedback
- [ ] **Visual Style Alignment**: Convert to 32x32 sprites or adjust spec to match current 64x64
- [ ] **Tower Animation**: Idle animations and firing effects
- [ ] **Tower Placement Feedback**: Enhanced visual feedback for placement/upgrade actions

### Game Completion Requirements
- [ ] **Final Game Balance**: Ensure all systems work harmoniously
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Smooth gameplay across all features
- [ ] **Bug Fixes**: Address any remaining issues
- [ ] **Final Testing**: Comprehensive playthrough validation

## Success Criteria
- Game fully matches specification requirements
- All core gameplay loops are complete and polished
- Visual style is consistent and professional
- Game sessions feel complete and satisfying
- All systems integrate seamlessly
- No major bugs or performance issues

## Technical Implementation Areas
- **Game State**: Win/lose conditions and game ending mechanics
- **Visual System**: Sprite size standardization or spec alignment
- **Animation System**: Tower animations and visual effects
- **Feedback System**: Enhanced interaction feedback
- **Performance**: Optimization and bug fixes

## Files Likely to be Modified
- `src/game.js` - Win/lose conditions and game state management
- `src/systems/RenderSystem.js` - Visual style alignment and animations
- `src/systems/TowerSystem.js` - Tower animations and placement feedback
- `src/managers/GameStateManager.js` - Game completion logic
- `src/data/towerTypes.js` - Animation and visual enhancement data
- `game-spec.md` - Potential spec updates for visual alignment

## Next Steps
- **Win/Lose Conditions**: Implement clear game ending mechanics
- **Visual Style Alignment**: Decide on sprite size standardization
- **Tower Animation**: Add idle animations and firing effects
- **Final Polish**: Complete all remaining polish items

## Session Log Updates
- **Session Start**: 2025-09-30 - Sprint 15 initialization
- **Branch Created**: feature/sprint-15-final-polish
- **Scope Defined**: Final polish and game completion

## Sprint 15 Progress Tracking
- **Current Focus**: Tower animation implementation
- **Next Priority**: Tower placement feedback enhancement
- **Status**: Visual alignment skipped, moving to tower animations

## Commit History
- **b82e279**: fix(game): stop wave system and enemy movement on win/lose conditions

## Completed Work
- **Win/Lose System**: Fully implemented and working
  - Game over when 5+ enemies reach goal
  - Victory when all 10 waves completed
  - Clear visual overlay with restart button
  - Debug keys added: L (test lose), W (test win)
  - Fixed bug: enemiesReachedGoal now tracks count instead of array
  - **Game stops completely** when win/lose conditions are met
  - Wave system stops spawning new enemies
  - Enemy movement stops
  - All game systems pause except input handling

- **Visual Style Alignment**: SKIPPED - Current 64x64 pixel behavior is satisfactory

- **Tower Animation System**: Complete implementation
  - Subtle idle pulsing animation (0.95-1.05 scale)
  - Brief firing flash animation (1.0-1.2 scale, 200ms duration)
  - Smooth animation integration with existing tower rendering
  - Automatic animation triggers when towers fire projectiles

- **Shoot Rate Variability System**: Complete implementation
  - Random fire rate variation: ±50ms for level 1, ±75ms for level 2, ±100ms for level 3
  - Natural staggered firing times for more realistic gameplay
  - **HUD Layout Redesigned**: Merged Portrait + Info sections for more space
  - Fire rate display: "Fire: 1750ms" with "FAST +25ms" status indicator
  - Color-coded status: Green for faster, orange for slower towers
  - Strategic depth: players can easily see which towers are performing better
