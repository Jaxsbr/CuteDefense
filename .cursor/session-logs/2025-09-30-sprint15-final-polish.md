## Session Log Updates
- **Session Start**: 2025-09-30 - Sprint 15 initialization
- **Branch Created**: feature/sprint-15-final-polish
- **Scope Defined**: Final polish and game completion

## Sprint 15 Progress Tracking
- **Current Focus**: Enemy selection and tower placement popup enhancements
- **Next Priority**: Final balance testing and comprehensive validation
- **Status**: Major UI enhancements completed, moving to final testing

## Commit History
- **8e74734**: feat(ui): add proposed tower HUD preview with pulsing animation
- **b82e279**: fix(game): stop wave system and enemy movement on win/lose conditions
- **3b34384**: feat(towers): add shoot rate variability with improved HUD layout

## Completed Work
- **Win/Lose System**: Fully implemented and working
  - Game over when 5+ enemies reach goal
  - Victory when all 10 waves completed
  - Clear visual overlay with restart button
  - Debug keys added: L (test lose), W (test win)
  - Fixed bug: enemiesReachedGoal now tracks count instead of array
  - **Game stops completely** when win/lose conditions are met
  - Wave system stops spawning new enemies
  - Enemy movement stops
  - All game systems pause except input handling

- **Visual Style Alignment**: SKIPPED - Current 64x64 pixel behavior is satisfactory

- **Tower Animation System**: Complete implementation
  - Subtle idle pulsing animation (0.95-1.05 scale)
  - Brief firing flash animation (1.0-1.2 scale, 200ms duration)
  - Smooth animation integration with existing tower rendering
  - Automatic animation triggers when towers fire projectiles

- **Shoot Rate Variability System**: Complete implementation
  - Random fire rate variation: ±50ms for level 1, ±75ms for level 2, ±100ms for level 3
  - Natural staggered firing times for more realistic gameplay
  - **HUD Layout Redesigned**: Merged Portrait + Info sections for more space
  - Fire rate display: "Fire: 1750ms" with "FAST +25ms" status indicator
  - Color-coded status: Green for faster, orange for slower towers
  - Strategic depth: players can easily see which towers are performing better

- **Enemy Selection System**: Complete implementation
  - Click on enemies to select them and view detailed stats in HUD
  - Enemy portrait with health bar, speed, reward, and special abilities
  - Visual feedback with pulsing animations and shape-based identification
  - Priority system: Enemy selection overrides tower selection
  - Clear selection when clicking empty space or placing towers

- **Tower Placement Popup Redesign**: Complete implementation
  - Modern popup design with gradient background and glow effects
  - Two tower options: Basic Tower (5 coins) and Strong Tower (15 coins)
  - Cost display and grayed-out buttons for insufficient funds
  - Tactile button design with tower icons and clear cost information
  - Improved positioning to stay within canvas bounds
  - Enhanced visual feedback matching game's aesthetic

- **Proposed Tower HUD Preview**: Complete implementation (Commit: 8e74734)
  - Shows proposed tower type in HUD selection pane when placement popup is open
  - Dimmed portrait (50% opacity) with "PROPOSED" label in gold
  - Pulsing animations: title blinks at 1Hz, background glow pulses smoothly
  - Brief descriptors: "Simple bullets | Very cheap" for Basic, "High damage | Slow fire" for Strong
  - Tower stats (cost, range) displayed with dimmed appearance
  - Auto-hides when popup closes or after placement
  - Mobile-safe animations with low alpha values
  - Priority system: enemies and selected towers override proposed preview

## Latest Implementation - Proposed Tower HUD Preview

### Implementation Complete
- **Feature**: HUD "Proposed Tower" preview when placement popup is shown
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/game.js` - Pass popup info to HUD renderer
  - `src/systems/RenderSystem.js` - Add proposed tower preview rendering

### Feature Details
✅ **Proposed Tower State**: Shows selected tower type from popup in HUD selection pane
✅ **Visual Distinction**: 
  - Dimmed portrait (50% opacity) with pulsing background glow
  - "PROPOSED" label in gold at bottom of portrait
  - "PROPOSED TOWER" title with 1Hz pulsing animation
✅ **Descriptive Text**:
  - Basic Tower: "Simple bullets | Very cheap"
  - Strong Tower: "High damage | Slow fire"
✅ **Tower Stats**: Cost and range displayed with dimmed appearance
✅ **Pulsing Animation**: 
  - Title blinks at ~1Hz (0.7-1.0 alpha)
  - Background glow pulses at 1Hz (0.05-0.25 alpha)
  - Mobile-safe with low alpha values
✅ **Auto-Hide**: Preview automatically hides when popup closes or after placement
✅ **Priority System**: Enemies and selected towers override proposed preview

### Testing Required
- Open placement popup and verify proposed tower preview appears
- Toggle between Basic and Strong tower types using cycle button
- Verify preview disappears when popup is closed
- Verify preview disappears when tower is placed
- Check that placed tower becomes selected after placement
- Verify pulsing animations are smooth and not excessive
