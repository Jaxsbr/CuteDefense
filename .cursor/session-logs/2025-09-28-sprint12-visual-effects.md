  - ‚úÖ Improved collection particle effects with more particles and rotation
  - ‚úÖ Added floating text effects for multi-value coins (+2, +3, etc.)
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced bounce animation with sway and variable timing per coin
  - ‚úÖ Added collection scaling animation (coins shrink when collected)
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/systems/ResourceSystem.js - Enhanced particle system and coin animations
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Improved coin rendering with glow and sparkles
- **Result**: Coins now have much more satisfying visual appeal and collection feedback
- **Next**: Test the enhanced coin collection animations

### 2025-09-28 17:37:00 - Coin Expiration System Implemented
- **Action**: Added coin expiration system with negative feedback animations and urgency mechanics
- **Changes Made**:
  - ‚úÖ Added coin lifetime tracking (10 seconds before expiration)
  - ‚úÖ Implemented warning system (3 seconds of warning animation)
  - ‚úÖ Added dramatic expiration effects with red particles and "-X" floating text
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced coin visual states: normal (gold), warning (pulsing orange/red), expired (dark gray)
  - ‚úÖ Added warning sparkles that intensify as expiration approaches
  - ‚úÖ Implemented coin scaling animation during expiration
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced particle effects with negative colors and larger impact
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/systems/ResourceSystem.js - Added expiration logic and negative effect particles
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Added warning states and negative visual feedback
- **Result**: Coins now expire with dramatic negative feedback, creating urgency and preventing clutter
- **Next**: Test the coin expiration system and visual feedback

### 2025-09-28 17:42:00 - Projectile Impact Effects Implemented
- **Action**: Enhanced projectile system with impact effects and bouncy animations
- **Changes Made**:
  - ‚úÖ Added impact effect particles when projectiles hit enemies
  - ‚úÖ Created damage number floating text showing damage dealt
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced projectile trails with gradient effects
  - ‚úÖ Added bouncy rotation animation to projectiles
  - ‚úÖ Implemented pulsing glow effects on projectiles
  - ‚úÖ Added sparkle effects around fast-moving projectiles
  - ‚úÖ Created impact particle system with rotation and gravity
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced visual feedback for successful hits
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Added impact effects system and particle management
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Enhanced projectile rendering and added impact effects
  - src/game.js - Added impact effects to main rendering loop
- **Result**: Projectiles now have satisfying impact effects with sparkles, damage numbers, and enhanced visual appeal
- **Next**: Test the projectile impact effects and enhanced animations

### 2025-09-28 17:47:00 - Wave Announcement Animations Enhanced
- **Action**: Enhanced wave announcement system with full-screen dramatic announcements
- **Changes Made**:
  - ‚úÖ Added full-screen wave announcement rendering to main game loop
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced announcement text with more kid-friendly and exciting messages
  - ‚úÖ Added screen shake effects for dramatic announcements (boss waves and countdowns)
  - ‚úÖ Integrated existing dramatic visual effects (sparkles, particles, color cycling)
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced announcement messages with motivational text and emojis
  - ‚úÖ Added different visual effects for different announcement types
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/game.js - Added wave announcement rendering to main loop
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Added screen shake effects for announcements
  - src/managers/EnemyManager.js - Enhanced announcement text with more excitement
- **Result**: Wave announcements now display as full-screen dramatic events with enhanced visual effects
- **Next**: Test the enhanced wave announcement system

### 2025-09-28 18:00:00 - Fixed Screen Shake Effect
- **Action**: Replaced jittery screen shake with dramatic corner blur pulse effect
- **Problem**: Screen shake looked like a CSS bug rather than a dramatic warning
- **Solution**: 
  - ‚úÖ Replaced screen shake with corner blur pulse effect
  - ‚úÖ Added radial gradient blur in all four corners
  - ‚úÖ Added subtle border pulse effect for dramatic warning
  - ‚úÖ Different intensity for boss waves vs regular countdown
  - ‚úÖ Smooth pulsing animation that looks intentional
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Replaced renderScreenShakeEffect with renderDramaticWarningEffect
- **Result**: Dramatic warning effect now looks intentional and professional, not like a bug
- **Next**: Test the improved dramatic warning effect

### 2025-09-28 18:03:00 - Enhanced Dramatic Warning Effect
- **Action**: Improved dramatic warning effect visibility and transition
- **Improvements**:
  - ‚úÖ Increased corner blur opacity from 0.3 to 0.6 for better visibility
  - ‚úÖ Increased border opacity from 0.6 to 0.8 for more dramatic effect
  - ‚úÖ Added smooth fade-out transition when wave state changes to spawning
  - ‚úÖ 1-second fade duration prevents sudden animation cutoff
  - ‚úÖ Proper announcementTime tracking for smooth transitions
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Enhanced opacity values and added fade-out logic
  - src/managers/EnemyManager.js - Ensured proper announcementTime tracking
- **Result**: Dramatic warning effect is now more visible and transitions smoothly
- **Next**: Test the enhanced dramatic warning effect with improved visibility and transitions
