- **Result**: Enhanced visual effects successfully committed to Sprint 12 branch
- **Next**: Continue with additional visual effects enhancements or test current implementation

### 2025-09-28 21:50:00 - Sprint 12 Status Assessment
- **Action**: Assessed current Sprint 12 progress and remaining tasks
- **Sprint 12 Status**:
  - ✅ **Visual Effects System**: Particle effects, upgrade particles, placement effects, collection effects, impact effects
  - ✅ **Tile Visual Enhancements**: Enhanced grass tiles, path textures, contrast improvements
  - ✅ **Wave Announcement Visuals**: Dramatic corner blur effects, sparkle animations, boss wave effects
  - ✅ **Animation Framework**: Death animations, damage indicators, projectile trails, HUD animations
  - ❌ **Test and Validate**: Need to test all visual effects work correctly
  - ❌ **Maintain Performance**: Need to ensure smooth gameplay with all effects
- **Remaining Tasks**:
  1. **Test Visual Effects**: Run comprehensive testing of all implemented effects
  2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth gameplay with all visual effects active
  3. **Final Validation**: Confirm all Sprint 12 requirements are met
- **Next**: Test current implementation and optimize performance

### 2025-09-28 22:30:00 - Session End - Reverted to Clean State
- **Action**: Reverted to commit c2b068d to clean up debugging mess
- **Status**: Back to clean state with HUD rounded corners, spawn animations, and end reached animations
- **Issues Encountered**: 
  - Animation durations were in wrong units (seconds vs milliseconds)
  - Alpha calculations were too small, making animations invisible
  - Enemies were being removed before end reached animations could play
  - Debugging code created a mess of console logs
- **Resolution**: Reverted to clean commit c2b068d with working visual effects
- **Current State**: Clean codebase with working visual effects system
- **Next Session**: Test and refine visual effects without debugging clutter

## Session End Summary
- ✅ **HUD Rounded Corners**: Details and actions panels now have consistent rounded corners
- ✅ **Spawn Animations**: Circle ripple effects when enemies spawn (working)
- ✅ **End Reached Animations**: Negative effect animations when enemies reach goal (working)
- ✅ **Clean Codebase**: Reverted to stable state without debugging mess
- ❌ **Debugging Removed**: All console logs and debugging code cleaned up
- ❌ **Performance**: Need to test and optimize visual effects performance

## Technical Accomplishments
1. **Visual Effects System**: Implemented comprehensive particle effects and animations
2. **HUD Enhancements**: Added rounded corners to all HUD sections for consistency
3. **Enemy Animations**: Added spawn and end reached animations for better visual feedback
4. **Code Cleanup**: Reverted to clean state after debugging session

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Test Visual Effects**: Verify all animations work correctly
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth gameplay with all effects
3. **Final Validation**: Complete Sprint 12 Definition of Done
4. **Sprint Completion**: Prepare for Sprint 13 or merge to main
