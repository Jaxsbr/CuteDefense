# Session: 2025-09-26 - Tower System Development

## Objective
Implement the tower system for CuteDefense, including:
1. Tower placement and management system
2. Tower types (Basic, Strong) with different properties
3. Tower targeting and shooting mechanics
4. Projectile system with visual effects
5. Tower upgrade system using collected coins
6. Integration with existing enemy and resource systems

## Current State
- Sprint 2 (Enemy System) completed successfully and merged to main
- All foundation systems working: Grid, Input, Render, Debug, Enemy
- Ready to begin Sprint 3: Tower System
- Creating feature branch from main

## Sprint 3: Tower System - Definition of Done
- [ ] Tower placement system with validation
- [ ] Basic tower type (shoots projectiles at nearest enemy)
- [ ] Strong tower type (slower but more powerful)
- [ ] Projectile system with visual effects
- [ ] Tower targeting and shooting mechanics
- [ ] Resource system for tower costs
- [ ] Manual test: Place towers, see them shoot at enemies

## Session Start Time
2025-09-26 10:57:56

## Session Progress Update
2025-09-26 11:20:28 - Tower System Implementation Complete

## Accomplishments
- **Tower Data Types**: Created towerTypes.js with Basic and Strong tower configurations
- **Tower System**: Implemented TowerSystem for individual tower behavior, targeting, and shooting
- **Tower Manager**: Created TowerManager for tower placement, validation, and resource management
- **Resource System**: Added ResourceSystem for coin collection and spending mechanics
- **Projectile System**: Integrated projectile movement and collision detection
- **Game Integration**: Updated game.js to integrate all tower systems
- **Rendering**: Added tower, projectile, and coin rendering to RenderSystem
- **HTML Integration**: Updated index.html with new script dependencies

## Technical Changes
- Files Created: 4 (towerTypes.js, TowerSystem.js, TowerManager.js, ResourceSystem.js)
- Files Modified: 3 (game.js, RenderSystem.js, GridSystem.js, index.html)
- New Systems: Tower placement, targeting, shooting, projectiles, resources
- Integration Points: Game loop, rendering pipeline, input handling, resource management

## Current Status
- Tower placement system: ✅ Complete
- Tower targeting and shooting: ✅ Complete  
- Projectile system: ✅ Complete
- Resource system: ✅ Complete
- Web server running on port 3456 for testing

## Testing Instructions
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3456
2. Click on buildable areas (green tiles) to place Basic towers (red circles)
3. Wait for enemies to spawn and watch towers automatically target and shoot
4. Use debug keys: D (debug), G (grid), P (path), C (collision areas)
5. Verify towers shoot projectiles at enemies within range
6. Check that towers cannot be placed on enemy path (brown tiles)

## Final Testing Results
- **Tower Placement**: ✅ PASS - Towers place on green tiles successfully
- **Path Validation**: ✅ PASS - Towers cannot be placed on enemy path (brown tiles)
- **Resource System**: ✅ PASS - Coins deducted when placing towers
- **Tower Targeting**: ✅ PASS - Towers automatically target and shoot at enemies
- **Projectile System**: ✅ PASS - Visual projectiles with collision detection
- **Console Logging**: ✅ PASS - Detailed debug information for troubleshooting

## Sprint 3 Completion Summary
All Sprint 3 objectives achieved:
- [x] Tower placement system with validation
- [x] Basic tower type (shoots projectiles at nearest enemy)
- [x] Strong tower type (slower but more powerful) 
- [x] Projectile system with visual effects
- [x] Tower targeting and shooting mechanics
- [x] Resource system for tower costs
- [x] Manual test: Place towers, see them shoot at enemies

## Final Commit
Commit: 54ee8f6 - feat(tower): complete Sprint 3 tower system with projectile mechanics

## Architecture Notes
- TowerManager handles tower placement, validation, and resource management
- TowerSystem handles individual tower behavior, targeting, and shooting
- ProjectileSystem integrated into TowerSystem for projectile movement
- ResourceSystem manages coin collection and spending
- Tower types defined in data layer for easy balancing
- Input system fixed: handleInput() called before input.update() to prevent click state reset

## Sprint 2 Recap
- Enemy spawning system: ✅ Complete
- Enemy movement along paths: ✅ Complete  
- Wave system with announcements: ✅ Complete
- Basic enemy types: ✅ Complete
- Debug system enhancements: ✅ Complete

## Next Session Priority
Sprint 3: Tower System
- Create TowerManager system
- Implement tower placement logic
- Add tower targeting and shooting
- Create projectile system
- Add resource management for tower costs

## Files to Create/Modify
- src/managers/TowerManager.js (new)
- src/systems/TowerSystem.js (new)
- src/data/towerTypes.js (new)
- src/systems/ProjectileSystem.js (new)
- src/systems/ResourceSystem.js (new)
- src/game.js (modify - integrate tower system)
- src/systems/GridSystem.js (modify - tower placement validation)

## Testing Strategy
- Manual test: Place towers, verify they target and shoot enemies
- Visual test: Debug mode shows tower ranges and targeting
- Integration test: Towers interact with enemies properly
- Performance test: Multiple towers shooting projectiles smoothly

## Architecture Notes
- TowerManager handles tower placement and management
- TowerSystem handles individual tower behavior and targeting
- ProjectileSystem handles projectile movement and collision
- ResourceSystem manages coin collection and spending
- Tower types defined in data layer for easy balancing
