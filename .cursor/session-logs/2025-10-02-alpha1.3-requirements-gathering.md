- ✅ **Area Damage**: Successfully hitting 2 enemies with 40 damage each
- ✅ **No Top-Left Bug**: Explosions happening at actual hit locations, not top-left corner

**Performance Metrics:**
- Prediction time: 0.17s (excellent)
- Hit accuracy: Multiple successful hits

- Coin generation: Proper reward system functioning

### Issues Resolved

## Session Progress: 01:35 NZDT - Ring Effect Coordinate System Fix

### ✅ COMPLETED - Ring Effect Coordinate System Fix

#### Critical Bug Fix
1. **Missing Context Save/Restore** - Ring effect rendering was missing `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()` calls
2. **Coordinate System Corruption** - `ctx.translate()` without proper context management was causing positioning issues
3. **Visual Effect Missing** - Ring effects were not appearing at correct locations due to coordinate system corruption

#### Technical Fix
- Added `ctx.save()` before `ctx.translate(effect.x, effect.y)`
- Added `ctx.restore()` after ring rendering to reset coordinate system
- Maintained all existing ring effect properties (color, thickness, glow, expansion)
- Added debug logging to track ring effect rendering

#### Expected Results
- Ring effects should now appear at correct bomb explosion locations
- No more visual effects appearing in top-left corner
- Proper coordinate system management for all visual effects

## Session Progress: 01:45 NZDT - Ring Effect Coordinate Corruption Fix

### ✅ COMPLETED - Ring Effect Coordinate Corruption Fix

#### Root Cause Identified
- **Coordinate Corruption in Update Loop** - The `updateImpactEffects` method was trying to update ALL effects with velocity calculations
- **Missing Velocity Properties** - Ring effects don't have `vx` and `vy` properties (they're static)
- **NaN Generation** - When you add `undefined` to a number, you get `NaN`, corrupting ring effect coordinates

#### Technical Fix
- Added check to only update position for effects that have velocity properties
- Ring effects now maintain their original coordinates
- Other effects (particles, damage text) continue to work as before

#### Code Fix
```javascript
// Only update position for effects that have velocity properties
if (effect.vx !== undefined && effect.vy !== undefined) {
    effect.x += effect.vx * (deltaTime / 1000);
    effect.y += effect.vy * (deltaTime / 1000);
}
```

## Session Progress: 02:00 NZDT - Balance & Visual Improvements Completed

### ✅ COMPLETED - Balance & Visual Improvements

#### Progressive Coin Scaling From Wave 1
1. **Progressive Coin Reduction** - Enemies drop 5% fewer coins for each wave from wave 1
2. **Exponential Scaling** - Uses `Math.pow(0.95, waveNumber - 1)` for smooth reduction from start
3. **Prevents Economic Snowballing** - Prevents players from accumulating too much money throughout the game
4. **Boss Wave Balance** - Boss wave multipliers still apply, but with reduced base rewards

#### Final Tower Size Scaling
5. **Level 1 Normalized Size** - All level 1 towers use same size (24px radius) regardless of type
6. **Level 2 Size** - Level 2 towers at 45% of tile (28.8px radius)
7. **Level 3 Size** - Level 3 towers at 60% of tile (38.4px radius)
8. **Clear Progression** - Significant visual differences between all levels

#### Technical Implementation
- Enhanced EnemyManager with progressive coin scaling from wave 1
- Updated RenderSystem with balanced level-based tower size scaling
- Maintained tile boundary constraints (max 60% of tile size)
- Preserved all existing tower functionality and visual effects

### Balance Impact
- **Progressive Economy**: Coin rewards decrease smoothly from wave 1 to prevent snowballing
- **Subtle Tower Progression**: Noticeable but reasonable size differences between tower levels
- **Economic Balance**: Prevents economic dominance throughout the entire game
- **Visual Satisfaction**: Clear but not overwhelming visual feedback for tower upgrades

## Ready for Next Phase Implementation
