## Current Game State Analysis

### HUD Layout (From Alpha 1.4)
- **Current**: 4-section vertical layout (upgrade, info, stats, controls)
- **Issue**: Not utilizing vertical space efficiently
- **Opportunity**: Better information density and visual hierarchy
- **Space Available**: Significant vertical space not being used effectively

### Coin System (Current)
- **Starting Amount**: Fixed starting coins (likely 20-30)
- **Issue**: No difficulty variation for testing
- **Bug**: Carryover from previous games corrupts balance testing
- **Required**: Easy (40 coins) and Hard (30 coins) modes

### Game Reset Logic
- **Current**: "Try Again" button exists but may not reset all state
- **Issue**: Coin amounts carry over to new games
- **Impact**: Corrupted game balance testing and inconsistent experience

### Boss System (Missing)
- **Current**: No boss enemies, only regular enemy waves
- **Required**: Unique bosses every 5th round with special abilities
- **Impact**: Major gameplay variety and excitement missing
