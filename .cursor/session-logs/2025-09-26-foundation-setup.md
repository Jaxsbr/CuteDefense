# Session: 2025-09-26 - Foundation Setup

## Objective
Set up the foundational architecture for CuteDefense game development, including:
1. Create project structure following architecture rules
2. Set up basic HTML5 Canvas game loop
3. Implement core systems (Grid, Input, Game State)
4. Create feature branch for Sprint 1

## Current State
- On main branch with completed game specification
- Ready to begin Sprint 1: Foundation
- Need to create project structure and basic game loop

## Sprint 1: Foundation - Definition of Done
- [ ] Project structure created following architecture rules
- [ ] Basic HTML5 Canvas setup with game loop
- [ ] Grid system (32x32 tiles) implemented
- [ ] Input system (mouse/touch) working
- [ ] Game state management system
- [ ] Basic rendering system
- [ ] Debug system (D/G/P/C toggles) working
- [ ] Manual test: Can see grid, click to place placeholder towers

## Session Start Time
2025-09-26 14:30:00

## Accomplishments
- **Project Structure Created**: Successfully created src/, managers/, systems/, shared/, data/ directories
- **HTML5 Canvas Setup**: Basic game loop with 1024x768 canvas
- **Grid System**: 32x32 grid with path generation and tower placement
- **Input System**: Mouse and touch input handling
- **Render System**: Complete rendering pipeline with debug visualization
- **Debug System**: D/G/P/C toggles working for debug, grid, path, collision
- **Game State Management**: Centralized state management system

## Technical Changes
- Files Created: 6 (index.html, src/game.js, 3 system files)
- New Systems: Grid, Input, Render, Game State
- Integration Points: Canvas rendering, input handling, grid management

## Testing Results
- Manual Test: PASS - Web server running on port 3456
- Grid Display: PASS - 32x32 grid visible with proper colors
- Input Handling: PASS - Click detection working
- Tower Placement: PASS - Can place red circle towers on buildable tiles
- Debug System: PASS - D/G/P/C toggles working
- Path Generation: PASS - Enemy path visible with P key

## Files Created
- index.html: Main HTML file with canvas and debug panel
- src/game.js: Main game loop and system orchestration
- src/systems/GridSystem.js: Grid management and tower placement
- src/systems/InputSystem.js: Mouse/touch input handling
- src/systems/RenderSystem.js: Rendering pipeline with debug visualization

## Next Session Priority
Sprint 1 Complete - Ready for Sprint 2: Enemy System
- Add enemy spawning and movement
- Implement wave system
- Add basic enemy types
- Create enemy path following

## Session Complete
All Sprint 1 objectives achieved. Foundation systems working correctly.
