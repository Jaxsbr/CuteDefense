# Session: 2025-09-26 - Wave Enhancement Development

## Objective
Enhance the wave system for CuteDefense, including:
1. Improved wave announcements with visual effects
2. Enhanced enemy variety (Fast, Strong enemy types)
3. Progressive difficulty scaling across waves
4. Better wave timing and preparation phases
5. Enhanced visual feedback for wave progression

## Current State
- Sprint 3 (Tower System) completed successfully and merged to main
- All core systems working: Grid, Input, Render, Debug, Enemy, Tower, Resource
- Tower placement, targeting, and projectile mechanics fully functional
- Ready to begin Sprint 4: Wave Enhancement

## Sprint 4: Wave Enhancement - Definition of Done
- [ ] Enhanced wave announcements with visual effects
- [ ] Fast enemy type (quick movement, low health)
- [ ] Strong enemy type (slow movement, high health)
- [ ] Progressive difficulty scaling (more enemies, stronger stats)
- [ ] Better wave timing with preparation phases
- [ ] Visual indicators for wave progression and difficulty
- [ ] Manual test: Experience enhanced waves with variety and progression

## Session Start Time

## Session Progress
2025-09-26 13:05:00 - Enhanced Wave System Implementation

## Accomplishments
- **Enhanced Wave Announcements**: Added detailed enemy composition display with pulsing visual effects
- **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**: Implemented scaling factors for health, speed, count, and rewards
- **Multi-line Announcements**: Wave announcements now show enemy types and counts
- **Visual Effects**: Added pulsing animation to wave announcements for better visibility
- **Scaled Enemy Types**: Enemies now get progressively stronger with each wave

## Technical Changes
- Files Modified: 3 (EnemyManager.js, RenderSystem.js, enemyTypes.js)
- Enhanced wave announcement system with enemy composition tracking
- Added progressive difficulty scaling with configurable multipliers
- Implemented multi-line text rendering with visual effects
- Updated wave configuration structure for better scalability

## Final Testing Results
- **Wave Announcements**: ✅ PASS - Dramatic effects only during 5-second countdown
- **Simple Countdown**: ✅ PASS - Clean "Next Wave in: Xs" during preparation
- **Kid-Friendly Messaging**: ✅ PASS - Emoji-rich, simple announcements without technical details
- **Centered Animation**: ✅ PASS - Gentle pulse effect stays perfectly centered
- **Progressive Difficulty**: ✅ PASS - Enemy scaling working across waves
- **Enemy Variety**: ✅ PASS - Fast and Strong enemies spawning with different behaviors

## Sprint 4 Completion Summary
All Sprint 4 objectives achieved:
- [x] Enhanced wave announcements with visual effects
- [x] Fast enemy type (quick movement, low health)
- [x] Strong enemy type (slow movement, high health)
- [x] Progressive difficulty scaling (more enemies, stronger stats)
- [x] Better wave timing with preparation phases
- [x] Visual indicators for wave progression and difficulty
- [x] Manual test: Experience enhanced waves with variety and progression

## Session End Time
2025-09-26 13:23:20

## Final Commit
Commit: 71e724c - feat(wave): refine countdown pulse effects for subtle centered animation

## Architecture Notes
- Wave announcements now have two modes: simple countdown and dramatic countdown
- Progressive difficulty scaling applied to health, speed, count, and rewards
- Enemy variety system working with Basic, Fast, and Strong types
- Visual effects system optimized for kid-friendly experience
- Wave timing enhanced with 15-second preparation phases
- All systems integrated smoothly with existing tower defense mechanics

## Next Session Priority
Sprint 4 complete - ready for Sprint 5 planning or additional polish features
