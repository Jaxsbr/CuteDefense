# Session: 2025-09-26 - Wave Enhancement Development

## Objective
Enhance the wave system for CuteDefense, including:
1. Improved wave announcements with visual effects
2. Enhanced enemy variety (Fast, Strong enemy types)
3. Progressive difficulty scaling across waves
4. Better wave timing and preparation phases
5. Enhanced visual feedback for wave progression

## Current State
- Sprint 3 (Tower System) completed successfully and merged to main
- All core systems working: Grid, Input, Render, Debug, Enemy, Tower, Resource
- Tower placement, targeting, and projectile mechanics fully functional
- Ready to begin Sprint 4: Wave Enhancement

## Sprint 4: Wave Enhancement - Definition of Done
- [ ] Enhanced wave announcements with visual effects
- [ ] Fast enemy type (quick movement, low health)
- [ ] Strong enemy type (slow movement, high health)
- [ ] Progressive difficulty scaling (more enemies, stronger stats)
- [ ] Better wave timing with preparation phases
- [ ] Visual indicators for wave progression and difficulty
- [ ] Manual test: Experience enhanced waves with variety and progression

## Session Start Time
2025-09-26 12:50:35

## Session Progress
2025-09-26 13:05:00 - Enhanced Wave System Implementation

## Accomplishments
- **Enhanced Wave Announcements**: Added detailed enemy composition display with pulsing visual effects
- **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**: Implemented scaling factors for health, speed, count, and rewards
- **Multi-line Announcements**: Wave announcements now show enemy types and counts
- **Visual Effects**: Added pulsing animation to wave announcements for better visibility
- **Scaled Enemy Types**: Enemies now get progressively stronger with each wave

## Technical Changes
- Files Modified: 3 (EnemyManager.js, RenderSystem.js, enemyTypes.js)
- Enhanced wave announcement system with enemy composition tracking
- Added progressive difficulty scaling with configurable multipliers
- Implemented multi-line text rendering with visual effects
- Updated wave configuration structure for better scalability
