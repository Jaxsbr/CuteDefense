## Game Balance Analysis

### Current Balance Issues
1. **Early Game**: Too easy - players can survive without strategy
2. **Mid Game**: Sudden difficulty spike - overwhelming enemy waves
3. **Late Game**: Inconsistent difficulty - some waves trivial, others impossible
4. **Tower Costs**: Economic balance needs adjustment
5. **Enemy Health**: Scaling may be too aggressive

### Balance Solutions
1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Smoother difficulty curve
2. **Economic Rebalancing**: Tower costs and coin rewards
3. **Enemy Scaling**: More predictable health/damage progression
4. **Wave Composition**: Better enemy type distribution
5. **Boss Integration**: Strategic boss placement

## Technical Architecture

### New Systems Required
- **BossSystem**: Manages boss enemy spawning and behavior
- **FreezeSystem**: Handles freeze effects and enemy speed modification
- **CoinCollectorSystem**: Automatic coin collection mechanics
- **MobileSystem**: Touch controls and responsive UI
- **BalanceSystem**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment

### Integration Points
- **EnemyManager**: Boss enemy integration

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- [x] **Responsive UI Scaling** - Menu and HUD adapt to screen size
- [x] **Grid Layout Optimization** - 30-column grid with centered positioning
- [x] **Canvas Sizing** - Perfect fit for emulator (2560x1169)

### Known Bugs (Post-Implementation)
- [ ] **Tower Placement Menu** - Not appearing when clicking on buildable tiles
- [ ] **Click Detection** - Enemies and towers not clickable for selection
- [ ] **Night Cycle Rendering** - Dark overlay only affects top portion of grid, not bottom

### Technical Issues Identified
1. **Coordinate System Issues**: Grid offset calculations may be incorrect
2. **Click Event Handling**: Screen-to-grid conversion not working properly
3. **Rendering Pipeline**: Night cycle overlay positioning needs adjustment

### Debugging Required
- Verify `screenToGrid()` and `gridToScreen()` calculations
- Check click event propagation and handling
- Investigate night cycle overlay rendering logic
- Test tower placement popup trigger conditions
