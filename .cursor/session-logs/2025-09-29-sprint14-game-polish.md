## Sprint 14 Definition of Done

### Core Gameplay Polish
- [ ] **Visual Style Alignment**: Convert to 32x32 sprites or adjust spec to match current 64x64
- [x] **Manual Coin Collection**: Implement tap-to-collect coin mechanics
- [x] **Enhanced Tower Upgrades**: Clear visual improvements for upgrades
- [ ] **Wave Announcement Polish**: Improved visual/audio wave announcements
- [ ] **Tactile Feedback**: Enhanced interaction feedback and animations

### Game Balancing & Session Management
- [ ] **Session Length Optimization**: Balance gameplay for 5-10 minute play cycles
- [ ] **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**: More sophisticated enemy scaling system
- [ ] **Game Pace Tuning**: Optimize wave timing and preparation phases
- [ ] **Win/Lose Conditions**: Clear game ending mechanics and feedback

### Day/Night Visual System
- [x] **Visual Phase Changes**: Implement day/night visual transitions
- [x] **Atmosphere Enhancement**: Different visual feels for preparation vs combat phases
- [x] **Lighting Effects**: Ambient lighting changes between phases
- [x] **Color Palette Adjustments**: Day/night color scheme variations

### Advanced Enemy System
- [ ] **Sophisticated Enemy Behaviors**: Enhanced AI and movement patterns
- [ ] **Advanced Enemy Types**: More complex enemy mechanics beyond basic stats
- [ ] **Enemy Formation Patterns**: Group behaviors and formation tactics
- [ ] **Dynamic Enemy Scaling**: Adaptive difficulty based on player performance

### Tower Graphics Enhancement
- [x] **Professional Tower Sprites**: Replace circle+letter placeholders with proper graphics
- [x] **Tower Visual Progression**: Clear visual improvements for upgrade levels
- [ ] **Tower Animation**: Idle animations and firing effects
- [ ] **Tower Placement Feedback**: Enhanced visual feedback for placement/upgrade actions

## Success Criteria
- Game visually matches specification requirements or spec updated to match implementation
- Coin collection feels satisfying and manual with proper feedback
- Tower upgrades show clear visual progression and improved graphics
- Wave transitions feel polished with day/night atmosphere
- Game sessions feel balanced for 5-10 minute play cycles
- Enemy behaviors feel more sophisticated and engaging
- All interactions have satisfying tactile feedback and visual polish

## Technical Implementation Areas
- **Visual System**: Sprite size standardization and graphics enhancement
- **Input System**: Enhanced tap-to-collect mechanics
- **Render System**: Day/night visual effects and lighting
- **Enemy System**: Advanced AI and behavior patterns
- **Tower System**: Graphics upgrade and visual progression
- **Game State**: Session length balancing and win/lose mechanics

## Files Likely to be Modified
- `src/systems/RenderSystem.js` - Visual enhancements and day/night system
- `src/systems/EnemySystem.js` - Advanced enemy behaviors
- `src/systems/TowerSystem.js` - Graphics and visual progression
- `src/systems/ResourceSystem.js` - Manual coin collection mechanics
- `src/managers/EnemyManager.js` - Enemy scaling and formation logic
- `src/game.js` - Session balancing and win/lose conditions
- `src/data/enemyTypes.js` - Advanced enemy type definitions
- `src/data/towerTypes.js` - Enhanced tower graphics and progression

## Next Steps
- ✅ **Tower Graphics Enhancement**: Complete with 3D dome, knobs, armor lines, and vertical bar rank badges
- ✅ **Manual Coin Collection**: Already implemented with tap-to-collect mechanics
- **Day/Night Visual System**: Atmospheric visual transitions between preparation and combat phases
- **Game Balancing**: Session length and difficulty optimization for 5-10 minute play cycles
- **Advanced Enemies**: More sophisticated enemy behaviors, formation patterns, and adaptive scaling

## Session Log Updates
- **Session Start**: 2025-09-29 - Sprint 14 initialization
- **Branch Created**: feature/sprint-14-game-polish
- **Scope Defined**: Comprehensive game polish across multiple systems

## Completed Work
- **Color Palette System**: Created blue-based palette with generic accent colors
- **Basic Tower Graphics**: Replaced circle+letter with 3D dome + organic details
- **Tower Visual Progression**: Level 1 (dome), Level 2 (+knobs), Level 3 (+armor lines/rivets)
- **Rank Badge Redesign**: Vertical bars instead of text, scaled for visibility
- **HUD Integration**: Selection portrait matches in-game tower graphics
- **Manual Coin Collection**: Confirmed already implemented
