## Session Log Updates
- **Session Start**: 2025-09-29 - Sprint 14 initialization
- **Branch Created**: feature/sprint-14-game-polish
- **Scope Defined**: Comprehensive game polish across multiple systems

## Completed Work
- **Color Palette System**: Created blue-based palette with generic accent colors
- **Basic Tower Graphics**: Replaced circle+letter with 3D dome + organic details
- **Tower Visual Progression**: Level 1 (dome), Level 2 (+knobs), Level 3 (+armor lines/rivets)
- **Rank Badge Redesign**: Vertical bars instead of text, scaled for visibility
- **HUD Integration**: Selection portrait matches in-game tower graphics
- **Manual Coin Collection**: Confirmed already implemented

## Session Accomplishments

### ✅ **Game Balance Overhaul**
- Session timing optimized (8s prep + 20s waves = 5-10 minute play cycles)
- Economic balance: cheap placement (5/15 coins) vs expensive upgrades (50-120 coins)
- Fire rate system fixed and balanced (lvl1:1800ms, lvl2:1350ms, lvl3:900ms)
- Enemy speed increased (30-40% faster) for more challenge
- Starting resources reduced to 20 coins for strategic decisions
- Coin rewards reduced by 70% for better balance

### ✅ **Advanced Enemy Formation System**
- Formation patterns: single, line, wedge, phalanx, swarm
- Strategic formation progression across waves (1-10)
- Formation-specific spawn timing and behavior modifiers
- Formation cohesion and speed adjustments for tactical gameplay
- Enhanced wave patterns with sophisticated enemy tactics

### ✅ **Wave Announcement Polish**
- Dramatic visual effects (pulsing, glow, shadows) for last 5 seconds
- Short, clean text format ("Next in: 05", "BOSS in: 05")
- Impact font for dramatic countdown (72px/68px)
- Proper timing: normal white text before 5s, dramatic effects in last 5s
- Boss wave detection and special orange glow effects

### ✅ **Debug Tools Enhancement**
- D key: Toggle debug mode + 2000 coins (increased from 200)
- N key: Skip to next wave (debug mode required)
