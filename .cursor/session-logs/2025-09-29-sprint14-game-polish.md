## Sprint 14 Definition of Done

### Core Gameplay Polish
- [ ] **Visual Style Alignment**: Convert to 32x32 sprites or adjust spec to match current 64x64
- [ ] **Manual Coin Collection**: Implement tap-to-collect coin mechanics
- [ ] **Enhanced Tower Upgrades**: Clear visual improvements for upgrades
- [ ] **Wave Announcement Polish**: Improved visual/audio wave announcements
- [ ] **Tactile Feedback**: Enhanced interaction feedback and animations

### Game Balancing & Session Management
- [ ] **Session Length Optimization**: Balance gameplay for 5-10 minute play cycles
- [ ] **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**: More sophisticated enemy scaling system
- [ ] **Game Pace Tuning**: Optimize wave timing and preparation phases
- [ ] **Win/Lose Conditions**: Clear game ending mechanics and feedback

### Day/Night Visual System
- [ ] **Visual Phase Changes**: Implement day/night visual transitions
- [ ] **Atmosphere Enhancement**: Different visual feels for preparation vs combat phases
- [ ] **Lighting Effects**: Ambient lighting changes between phases
- [ ] **Color Palette Adjustments**: Day/night color scheme variations

### Advanced Enemy System
- [ ] **Sophisticated Enemy Behaviors**: Enhanced AI and movement patterns
- [ ] **Advanced Enemy Types**: More complex enemy mechanics beyond basic stats
- [ ] **Enemy Formation Patterns**: Group behaviors and formation tactics
- [ ] **Dynamic Enemy Scaling**: Adaptive difficulty based on player performance

### Tower Graphics Enhancement
- [ ] **Professional Tower Sprites**: Replace circle+letter placeholders with proper graphics
- [ ] **Tower Visual Progression**: Clear visual improvements for upgrade levels
- [ ] **Tower Animation**: Idle animations and firing effects
- [ ] **Tower Placement Feedback**: Enhanced visual feedback for placement/upgrade actions

## Success Criteria
- Game visually matches specification requirements or spec updated to match implementation
- Coin collection feels satisfying and manual with proper feedback
- Tower upgrades show clear visual progression and improved graphics
- Wave transitions feel polished with day/night atmosphere
- Game sessions feel balanced for 5-10 minute play cycles
- Enemy behaviors feel more sophisticated and engaging
- All interactions have satisfying tactile feedback and visual polish

## Technical Implementation Areas
- **Visual System**: Sprite size standardization and graphics enhancement
- **Input System**: Enhanced tap-to-collect mechanics
- **Render System**: Day/night visual effects and lighting
- **Enemy System**: Advanced AI and behavior patterns
- **Tower System**: Graphics upgrade and visual progression
- **Game State**: Session length balancing and win/lose mechanics
