2. **HUD Redesign Implementation** - Implement improved HUD layout and functionality
3. **Basic Balancing Tweaks** - Adjust game balance parameters
4. **Test and Validate** - Ensure changes work correctly
5. **Commit Progress** - Save working state

## Progress Log

### 2025-09-27 17:35:00 - Session Start
- **Action**: Started Sprint 10 session for HUD redesign and basic balancing
- **Status**: Created feature branch from main, ready for spec gathering
- **Next**: Conduct spec gathering session for HUD redesign requirements

### 2025-09-27 17:40:00 - Spec Gathering Session Complete
- **Action**: Analyzed current HUD issues and defined new requirements
- **Current Issues Identified**:
  - Coin display shows on grid when nothing selected, then in HUD when tower selected (wrong)
  - Wave info gets overlapped by HUD on selection
  - HUD only shows when tower is selected (should always be visible)
- **New HUD Requirements**:
  - HUD panel always visible below game area
  - Five sections: Wave Info, Selection Portrait, Selection Info, Selection Actions, Coin Info
  - Selection can be tower, enemy, or nothing (always show selection section)
  - Cartoony feel with animations
  - Coin add/deduct animations
- **Next**: Begin HUD redesign implementation

### 2025-09-27 17:45:00 - HUD Redesign Implementation Complete
- **Action**: Implemented new always-visible HUD with five sections
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ Created `renderMainHUD()` method to replace conditional HUD rendering
  - ✅ Implemented five HUD sections: Wave Info, Selection Portrait, Selection Info, Selection Actions, Coin Info
  - ✅ Updated game loop to always render HUD (removed conditional rendering)
  - ✅ Updated HUD click handling for new section layout
  - ✅ Added color-coded sections with distinct backgrounds and borders
  - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with legacy `renderTowerHUD()` method
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - New HUD structure with five sections
  - src/game.js - Always render HUD, updated click handling
- **Result**: HUD now always visible below game area with proper section layout
- **Next**: Test functionality and add cartoony styling

### 2025-09-27 17:50:00 - Cartoony Styling and Animations Complete
- **Action**: Added cartoony feel and animations to HUD design
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ Added rounded corners and animated gradients to all HUD sections
