## Progress Log

### 2025-09-27 16:55:47 - Session Start
- **Action**: Started Sprint 9.5 session for adhoc changes
- **Status**: Created feature branch from main, ready for improvements
- **Next**: Identify specific changes needed

### 2025-09-27 16:56:48 - Sprint 9 Session Log Committed
- **Action**: Committed Sprint 9 session log to clean up uncommitted changes
- **Commit**: 5baebd2 - docs(session): complete Sprint 9 session log with enemy system enhancements
- **Result**: Clean working directory ready for Sprint 9.5 development

### 2025-09-27 16:58:26 - Increased Projectile Speed for Better Accuracy
- **Action**: Doubled base projectile speeds to improve tower accuracy
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Basic Tower: 200 → 400 pixels/second (doubled)
  - ✅ Strong Tower: 150 → 350 pixels/second (more than doubled)
- **Reason**: Towers were missing too much due to slow projectiles reaching enemies too late
- **Files Modified**: src/data/towerTypes.js
- **Result**: Projectiles should now reach targets much faster, improving accuracy
- **Next**: Test improved projectile speed with different enemy types

### 2025-09-27 17:03:25 - Implemented Guaranteed Hits with Consistent Speed
- **Action**: Made projectiles hit all enemies guaranteed with consistent speed across all towers
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ All towers now use 800 pixels/second projectile speed (very fast for guaranteed hits)
  - ✅ Basic Tower fire rate: 1000ms → 1500ms (slower for balance with guaranteed hits)
  - ✅ Strong Tower fire rate: 2000ms → 2500ms (even slower for balance with guaranteed hits)
  - ✅ Removed projectile speed scaling on upgrades - consistent speed maintained
- **Reason**: User feedback - projectiles still missing fast diamond enemies, want guaranteed hits with balance through fire rate/damage
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/data/towerTypes.js - Consistent 800px/s speed, adjusted fire rates
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Removed speed scaling on upgrades
- **Result**: All projectiles should now hit enemies consistently, balance achieved through fire rate differences
- **Next**: Test that diamond enemies are now consistently hittable

### 2025-09-27 17:09:19 - Attempted Scale Increase (Incorrect Approach)
- **Action**: Attempted to increase individual element sizes (incorrect approach)
- **Changes**: Reverted - this was not the correct way to scale the game
- **Reason**: Misunderstood user request - they wanted grid scale change, not individual size changes

### 2025-09-27 17:12:02 - Corrected Grid Scale Implementation
- **Action**: Implemented proper grid scale change from 32x32 to 64x64
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Reverted all incorrect individual size changes
  - ✅ Grid scale already set to 64x64 in game.js CONFIG
  - ✅ All positioning calculations use 64px tile size
  - ✅ Centering offsets correctly use +32px (half of 64px tiles)
- **Reason**: User clarification - wanted grid scale change, not individual element size changes
- **Files Checked**: 
  - src/game.js - CONFIG already has GRID_SIZE: 64, TILE_SIZE: 64
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Uses 64px tile size with +32px centering
  - All systems properly scaled to 64x64 grid
- **Result**: Game already uses 64x64 grid scale - everything should appear larger and more cute
- **Next**: Test that 64x64 grid scale provides the desired visual improvement

### 2025-09-27 17:15:34 - Scaled Game to 128x128 Grid Factor
- **Action**: Scaled entire game from 64x64 to 128x128 for much larger and more cute visuals
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Grid size: 64px → 128px (doubled)
  - ✅ Grid dimensions: 16x12 → 8x6 (halved to maintain canvas size)
  - ✅ All positioning: Updated from +32px to +64px centering
  - ✅ Collision detection: Updated to 128px tile scale with 16px tolerance
  - ✅ Projectiles: 8px → 16px (scaled for 128px tiles)
  - ✅ Coins: 16px → 24px radius (scaled for 128px tiles)
  - ✅ Upgrade particles: 4-8px → 8-16px (scaled for 128px tiles)
  - ✅ All distance calculations: Updated for 128px tiles
- **Reason**: User feedback - 64x64 still too small, wanted 128x128 scale for cute visuals
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/game.js - Updated CONFIG to 128px grid, 8x6 dimensions
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Updated all positioning and collision for 128px tiles
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Updated rendering calculations for 128px tiles
- **Result**: Everything now 4x larger than original 32x32 scale - much more cute and visually appealing
- **Next**: Test that 128x128 scaling provides the desired cute visual improvement

### 2025-09-27 17:20:51 - Fixed Missing 128x128 Scaling for UI Elements
- **Action**: Fixed projectiles, coins, HUD, and tower popup to properly scale with 128x128 grid
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Projectiles: Trail width 3→6px, glow blur 8→16px, border 2→4px
  - ✅ Coins: Border width 3→6px, sparkle font 20→32px, position adjusted
  - ✅ Tower popup: Size 60→120px, buttons 20→40px, fonts 16→32px, borders scaled
  - ✅ HUD: Height 120→240px, padding 15→30px, portrait 80→160px, info width 200→400px
  - ✅ HUD fonts: Tower info 18→36px, level text 16→32px, upgrade text 16→32px, cost 14→28px
  - ✅ HUD borders: Main border 3→6px, inner border 1→2px
- **Reason**: User feedback - projectiles, coins, HUD, and tower popup didn't scale with 128x128 grid
- **Files Modified**: src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Fixed all UI element scaling
- **Result**: All UI elements now properly scaled for 128x128 grid - complete visual consistency
- **Next**: Test that all elements now scale properly together

### 2025-09-27 17:28:56 - Reverted Scaling Back to 64x64
- **Action**: Reverted all scaling changes back to 64x64 due to collision accuracy and HUD issues
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Grid config: 128px→64px, 8x6→16x12 dimensions
  - ✅ All positioning: +64px→+32px centering, 128px→64px tile calculations
  - ✅ Collision detection: 128px→64px tile scale, 16px→8px tolerance
  - ✅ Projectiles: Size 16→8px, trail width 6→3px, glow blur 16→8px, border 4→2px
  - ✅ Coins: Radius 24→16px, border 6→3px, sparkle font 32→20px
  - ✅ HUD: Height 240→120px, padding 30→15px, portrait 160→80px, info width 400→200px
  - ✅ HUD fonts: All reverted to original sizes (18px, 16px, 14px, 12px)
  - ✅ Tower popup: Size 120→60px, buttons 40→20px, fonts 32→16px
  - ✅ Upgrade particles: Size 8-16→4-8px
- **Reason**: User feedback - collision accuracy and HUD not working properly with 128x128 scale
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/game.js - Reverted CONFIG to 64px grid, 16x12 dimensions
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Reverted all positioning and collision to 64px tiles
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Reverted all UI element scaling to 64px scale
- **Result**: Game back to stable 64x64 scale with proper collision and HUD functionality
- **Next**: Test that collision accuracy and HUD work properly at 64x64 scale
