## Progress Log

### 2025-09-27 16:23:34 - Session Start
- **Action**: Started Sprint 9 session with enemy system focus
- **Status**: Created feature branch from main, ready to begin development
- **Next**: Analyze current enemy system implementation

### 2025-09-27 16:26:19 - Sprint 9 Implementation Complete
- **Action**: Completed all Sprint 9 enemy system enhancements
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/data/enemyTypes.js - Enhanced enemy types with visual properties
  - src/systems/EnemySystem.js - Improved movement, animations, and effects
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Enhanced collision detection and targeting
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Added shape-based rendering and health bars
  - src/managers/EnemyManager.js - Improved wave progression and scaling
- **Key Accomplishments**:
  - ✅ Enhanced enemy types with visual differentiation (circle, diamond, square shapes)
  - ✅ Improved enemy pathfinding with smooth movement interpolation
  - ✅ Enhanced collision detection system with size-based collision
  - ✅ Improved tower targeting with intelligent enemy prioritization
  - ✅ Enhanced wave progression with boss waves and difficulty scaling
  - ✅ Added enemy animations, damage flash effects, and health bars
  - ✅ Dynamic spawn intervals and balanced difficulty scaling
- **Result**: All Sprint 9 Definition of Done items completed
- **Next**: Test complete enemy wave gameplay

### 2025-09-27 16:34:28 - Projectile System Fixes
- **Action**: Fixed critical projectile behavior issues identified during testing
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - ✅ Projectiles no longer disappear when target dies - now use TTL (Time To Live)
  - ✅ Fast diamond enemies can now be hit - improved collision detection with tolerance
  - ✅ Projectiles use direction-based movement instead of target-based
  - ✅ Enhanced collision detection with 8px tolerance for better hit detection
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Projectiles now have 2-second TTL and max distance limits
  - Direction-based movement with normalized vectors
  - Collision detection checks all alive enemies, not just specific target
  - Added collision radius tolerance for fast-moving enemies
- **Files Modified**: src/systems/TowerSystem.js
- **Result**: Projectile system now works correctly with all enemy types
- **Next**: Test fixes with all enemy types

### 2025-09-27 16:37:41 - Projectile Visibility Fixes
- **Action**: Fixed projectile speed and visibility issues
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - ✅ Projectiles now move at proper speed (removed 64x multiplier)
  - ✅ Increased projectile size from 8px to 12px for better visibility
  - ✅ Added trail effects for better visual tracking
  - ✅ Enhanced projectile rendering with glow and bright center
  - ✅ Extended TTL from 2 to 3 seconds for better tracking
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Fixed speed calculation (removed incorrect 64x multiplier)
  - Added trail system with 5-point trail history
  - Enhanced rendering with glow effects and bright white center
  - Improved visual feedback with semi-transparent trails
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Fixed speed and added trail system
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Enhanced projectile rendering
- **Result**: Projectiles are now clearly visible and properly paced
- **Next**: Test projectile visibility and hit feedback

### 2025-09-27 16:41:17 - Projectile Size Adjustment
- **Action**: Reduced projectile size for better visual balance
- **Change**: Projectile size reduced from 12px to 8px
- **Reason**: Feedback indicated projectiles were too large
- **Result**: Projectiles now have balanced size - visible but not overwhelming

### 2025-09-27 16:44:43 - Upgrade Effects and Projectile Speed Scaling
- **Action**: Added upgrade particle effects and projectile speed scaling
- **Features Added**:
  - ✅ Upgrade particle animation when towers are upgraded
  - ✅ Projectile speed increases per tower level
  - ✅ Basic towers get smaller speed increases (10px/s per level)
  - ✅ Strong towers get larger speed increases (20px/s per level)
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Added upgrade particle system with 12 particles in circular pattern
  - Particles fade out over time with glow effects
  - Projectile speed scaling based on tower type
  - Enhanced visual feedback for tower upgrades
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/systems/TowerSystem.js - Added particle system and speed scaling
  - src/systems/RenderSystem.js - Added particle rendering
- **Result**: Tower upgrades now have clear visual feedback and improved projectile performance
- **Next**: Test upgrade effects and speed scaling
